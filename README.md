# LLM Protocol Validation via Robotic Simulation

## Overview

This project implements a simulation-based validation layer for an AI Scientist system that generates laboratory experimental protocols using large language models. The goal is to prevent physically impossible or unsafe experiments by grounding LLM outputs in robotic and physical constraints before execution.

The system focuses on liquid-handling experiments and validates protocols through a PyLabRobot-based simulation environment.
